===============================================================


Different hand tools 
====================
There are mainly two types of hand tools and they are layout tools and tooth edge cutting tools.

1) Layout Tools
---------------

    a) **Scriber**
        Scriber is handheld tool which used to obtain accurate layout. It is used to scribe fine lines in metal surface. 

    b) **Divider**
        Divider are used to draw circles, arcs and radii. The length of the divider must be equal and kept sharp.

    c) **Trammel**
        It is used for drawing circles, arcs and radii that are too large to draw by divider. It has three parts and they are beam, two sliding heads with scriber points and adjusting screw attached to one of the sliding head.

    d) **Hermaphrodite caliper**
        It is a handheld tool used to draw lines that are parallel with the edges of the workpiece. Similarly, it also helps to locate the centre of cylindrical workpiece.

    e) **Surface gauge**
        Surface gauge is use to layout lines at parallel position to the work surface.

    f) **Surface plate**
        Surface plate is a smooth flat table used as a horizontal reference plane for precision inspection and layout lines. Surface plates are made from granite or cast iron. 

    g) **Combination square set**
        The combination square set is used for a number of layout operations. The set consists of blade (i.e. graduated rule), square head, protractor, and center head.

2) Tooth edge cutting tools
---------------------------
a) **Saw**
    Handsaw is the most popular tool in carpentry jobs. It has one flat and other sharp edge which is used to cut wood into pieces.
    It is available in two types and they are:

        * ``Straight line cutting saw``
        * ``Curve line cutting saw``

b) **Shaving and shaping tools**

    * Plane
        It the traditional and popular tool for shaping wood. It is used for flattening, reducing thickness and making a smooth surface of any rough wooden workpiece.

    * Chisel
        It has a sharp cutting edge at one end and handle at another. It is mostly used for cutting or carving purposes.
    



    * Utility knife
        It is general or utility purpose knife used by carpenter to cut, trim, sharpen or draw lines  *

    * Sandpaper
        It is used to create and ultra-smooth surface of the workpiece. It is used in workpiece before applying lubricant or oil-based finish
    
    * File and rasp
        Files and rasps are used for shaping wooden material. Both has coarse, individual teeth in the steel surface which is used for smoothing and shaping the lumber.

    Some of the smooth facing tools are shave, jack plane, fore plane, trying plane, jointer, smooth plane, moulding and special plane. Similarly, other sharp edged cutting tools are paring chisel, firming chisel, framing chisel and side blade.



c) **Drilling or boring**
    A hand drill is a used to drill for tightening fasteners like screws and bolts.
    A boring machine is a hand driven machine which is used to bore holes in wooden workpiece. Carpenters uses different tools like hand drill, hammer and a nail, chisel etc. for boring purposes.
    Different types of drilling tools are brad awls, gimlets, augers, twist drills, hollow augers, spoke pointers and reamers.

d) **Striking and driving**
    Striking tools are hand tool with weighted head attached to a handle which is used for striking purposes like inserting nails and bending nails.
    Driving tools are used to push or drive screws and bolts into the wooden surfaces with mechanical or manual force.
       
        * ``Hammer and mallet``
        * ``Nails and screws``
        * ``Screwdriver``
        * ``Punch``
        * ``Hold fast``

Different types of power tools
==============================

Different types of power tools available are listed below:

1) Saw
------

Power saw is used for cutting woods with ease. There are various types of saws available in market and some of them are:
    a) **Circular saw**
        It has toothed or abrasive disc or blade which cuts woods and other materials using a rotary motion.
    
    b) **Jig saw**
        It has an electric motor and a reciprocating saw blade and is used in making curves, intricate cuts in wood and other materials.
    
    c) **Reciprocating saw**
        This saw is used for quick cuts. It cuts wood through reciprocating (or push and pull) motion of the blade.
    
    d) **Miter saws**
        This saw has miter box fitted with guides for 45° and 90° cutting. It is mostly used in molding and trimming.
    
    e) **Table saw**
        It is used for ripping, crosscutting, mitering and beveling. It is not portable but has versatile features.

2) Power drill 
--------------
(Refer in bricklaying section 5.3)





3) Power Jointer
----------------

A power jointer is a tool used for making smooth and flat surface of warped, twisted or bowed wooden board. It is also used to straighten and square edge after the boards are flat.

The wood lathe machine
======================

Woodturning is a type of woodworking used to create wooden objects on a lathe machine. A wood lathe is a power tool that allows to shape a piece of wood by rotating it on an axis and using various carving tools. It is used to for turning a piece of wood into desired shape like bowl, spindle, vase or other decorative items.
