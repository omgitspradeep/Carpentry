<h2>Temporary structure<a class="headerlink" href="#temporary-structure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Carpentry means the construction of timber with primary concern of strength. Temporary carpentry is the woodwork that is necessary in the execution of constructional work but does not form a permanent part of the completed building or structure. Temporary structure is mostly used in purposes like excavations and centering for arches.
An excavation is used for inserting the foundations and foundation walling of a structure and also, for laying a drain and the provision of a basement. Ground tracing is done by laying down the excavation lines and centre lines on the ground before the excavation starts. After the foundation design is done then ground tracing plan or foundation layout plan is prepared with suitable scale and is fully dimensioned.
During the erection of structures and arches, temporary supports are necessary until it can support itself and this type of support is known as centering. For example, temporary support for concrete works like floors, lintols, roofs are called as shuttering. Temporary structure is used in many areas like flat and curved arches, concrete floor and roof slabs, joggled lintols, domes and ornamental works.</p>

<h2>Structural medium (Permanent structure)<a class="headerlink" href="#structural-medium-permanent-structure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Carpentry is known for strength of wooden structure which are built to carry load or to resist pressure producing considerable stresses irrespective of type or class or surface finish of the wood. Some popular permanent structure made from timbers are partitions, floors and roofs.</p>
<p>Wood Lintel is a horizontal beam placed across the opening of doors and windows to carry part or whole load from the walling above. And it provides a convenient medium for fixing wooden frames within the opening.</p>

<p>Ground floors in houses uses joists laid across short span, which is covered with boards so that the floor is raised above the earth. Joints are the timbers supporting boards and the boards are the thin slabs of wood laid upon the joists.</p>
<p>Roof is the covering of any structure especially in building. Its construction consists of supports and coverings. Coverings are the sheets of special felt corrugated iron, tiles, rubber preparations and other materials. With the help of roof members used in construction like rafter, jack rafter, purlin and wall plate, and roof accessories like eaves gutter, down pipe, roof boarding and tiles and slate batten, roof is constructed as an instance of permanent carpentry.</p>

<dt>Joinery is the process of joining or connecting two or more pieces of wood by using simple techniques of gluing, nailing or screwing. A joiner is a skilled person who joins workpieces to create a useful wooden product. Joinery is distinguished from carpentry by the kind of woodwork. Some kinds of joinery work that requires skilled joiner are:</dt><dd><ul class="simple">
<li><p>Kitchen cabinetmaking</p></li>

<h2>Furniture Making<a class="headerlink" href="#furniture-making" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Furniture making is an art of converting timber into a useful as well as valuable furniture products like chair and tables. It requires artistic vision and experience with tool handling, wood selection and preservation. Furniture used for various purposes are designed and they are table and chairs, stool, desk and benches, couch, bed, drawers and cloth rack, kitchen cabinet, podium and so on.</p>

<div class="section" id="tools-handle-making">
<h2>Tools handle making<a class="headerlink" href="#tools-handle-making" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First consideration for tools handle making is the shape and size of your tool handle. The ratio of overhang over the toolrest with respect to the overall tool handle length and heft need to be considered earlier. Similarly, geometry of shaft is also another factor to be consider while tool handle making. Also, you need to be sure that whether the tool will be permanently fixed in the handle or is removable. After that selected hard wood with straight grains is worked out in wood lathe to make the desired tool handle.</p>

<h2>Paper and cardboards<a class="headerlink" href="#paper-and-cardboards" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A paper is a thin and flat material made by crushing or pressing together moist fibres of cellulose pulp generated from trees and grass. It is used for sketching and writing about the design of the workpiece.  Cardboard is also a type of paper with greater thickness and superior durability. It is used to make containers in packaging industry. For example, paperboard is put in layer to create “corrugated container” which is used mostly in packaging products like noodles, biscuits, electronic devices and gifts.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Fibreboard</p>
<p>Fibreboard is prepared by breaking down of hard or soft woods into fibres and then bonded together with wax, resin and heat to create a thick material. MDF (Medium Density Fibreboard) is the popular and strong fibreboard.</p>

<div class="admonition-chipboard admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Chipboard</p>
<p>Chipboard is also called particle board which is prepared by bonding wood chips and shavings together with the help of resin. It is popular for making furniture.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Veneer</p>
<p>Veneer is a thin layer of wood taken from circumference of a tree and then bonded onto a dense piece of wood like fibreboard, chipboard and plywood.  It is used for making high quality furniture.</p>
